//! # block_compression
//!
//! Texture block compression using WGPU compute shader.
//! The shaders are a port of Intel's ISPC Texture Compressor's kernel to WGSL compute shader.
//!
//! Tested with the following backends:
//!
//! * DX12
//! * GL
//! * Metal
//! * Vulkan
//!
//! ## Supported block compressions
//!
//! Currently supported block compressions are:
//!
//!  * BC1
//!  * BC2
//!  * BC3
//!  * BC4
//!  * BC5
//!  * BC7
//!  * BC6H
